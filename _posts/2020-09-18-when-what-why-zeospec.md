Hey buddy what is the meaning of ZeoSpec? Is ZeoSpec your company? … and then some, so let’s dive into the story behind “ZeoSpec”

### Bit of History

During my gaming days, I used the username **ace_a_01** *(I guess)*. I was creating a new account and turns out my old username was not available, in a hurry to conclude the account setup I tried all the combinations that I could think of but none of them were available. Frustrated, I started typing my full name “Arun Teja Godavarthi”.

Credits to the character limit the text got trimmed as **aruntejagod**[^1]. 

I went about having aruntejagod as my username on all platforms, only because it was unique and available on all platforms.

### When?

It was around the beginning of 2018, the part of my username[^2] that I never certainly granted much attention to, started gaining traction.

I commemorate a stable friend mentioning “you will change that, I have seen many crazy names and then they change it after sometime …” well, he was right.

In March 2018, I sat down in the office over a weekend, considering the username, if it is important etc., credits to my kiddo brains I landed with some crazy thoughts.

### Why?

Being a considerably low-profile person on social media platforms, as time progressed developer communities, events and then Rotaract became an integral part of my life. You might have guessed it by now … #start of GOD mode problems.

“Hey bhagwan se suggestion aagaya!!!”(English: Hey God has given suggestions!!!) one of those fun conversations.

### What?

Early March of 2018, I started thinking about the change of username, after spending about a week … I found and compiled a few words to be used as a username.

*Checklist I ensured (in no particular order):*

- Does it have the lowest search results in google?
- Is it Unique (unused)?
- Does it have a meaning? Is it sensible? 
- And so on …

I finally shortlisted 3 names after trying at least 40 - 60 combinations. Of those here are my thoughts on the 2 that were the closing picks:

#### TallTeja

Let's start with the first one “TallTeja”, it was formed by a simple combination of my physical attribute of being tall and then the middle/second name “Teja”.

It ticks all the boxes, even today it has the lowest search results on google search, THREE to be specific[^3].

Then why ZeoSpec? Why not TallTeja?

#### ZeoSpec

While there is no meaning to it as a word, similar to the previous one … ZeoSpec was the combination of two words **Zeo** & **Spec**.

##### Zeo:

Being an anime lover I looked at Zeo as The Last Ultimate lifeform. Though I later found another meaning to it “Holy Spirit”.

##### Spec:

Being an Electrical Engineering student Spec was just an abbreviated form of Specification. Months later, I accidentally realised that Spec has another definition “In the hope of success but without any specific plan or instructions”.

And coming to the search results, I was getting approximately 60 of which 2 were related.

### Verdict Time:

TallTeja was defining a physical attribute and missed that catchy feel, So considering everything I picked ZeoSpec as the word of choice. On 11 March 2018, I started updating the username on all the existing platforms, days later it was ZeoSpec time.

*Many meanings for ZeoSpec, pick the one you cherish:*
- The Ultimate Specification
- The Ultimate hope of success
- Holy Spirit in the hope of success but without any specific plan or instructions
- And more ...

Thank you, hope you had fun reading my madness!
